# Iris RssCrawler

## About 
The Iris RssCrawler is a relatively quickly developed piece of software capable of taking a loading a series of Rss Feed urls from a database and then writing information concerning the articles back into the Db. 
The information written back includes the headline, description, publication date, base caegory url of the article and an id to link it back to the feed it originally came from. 

## Why? 
The RssCrawler is a preliminary component, designed merely to archive a large quantity of data. Further components will take and process the data - however this tool is intended to act outside of that due to the simpler nature of its taks.
